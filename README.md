##### Filter

[Include](#include-filter) and [Exclude](#exclude-filter) filters can be defined to filter Log Entries.

Log Message, Exception Classname (including package name) and Exception Message are used to filter Log Entry.

If property is not set, no filtering is applied.

Multiple strings can be separated by `;`

If Log Entry contains at least ONE string from this list, it's discarded.
